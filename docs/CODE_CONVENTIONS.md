# Code Conventions

This document defines coding standards for Mais. The goal is consistent,
readable, and maintainable code.

## General Rules

- Use clear and descriptive names.
- Keep indentation consistent (4 spaces unless file style differs).
- Target line length around 80 to 100 characters.
- Prefer small, focused functions over large monolithic blocks.
- Avoid duplicated logic (DRY principle).
- Add comments only when intent is not obvious.
- Validate inputs and handle errors explicitly.

## C++ Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for classes and `camelCase` for functions and variables.
- Prefix member fields with `_`.
- Use `nullptr` instead of `NULL` or `0`.
- Prefer RAII and smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`).
- Apply `const` correctness whenever possible.
- Prefer `enum class` over unscoped enums.

## Class Layout

In class declarations, keep sections in this order:

1. `public`
2. `protected`
3. `private`

Within each section, keep this order:

1. Types (`struct`, `enum`, aliases)
2. Constructors and special members
3. Methods
4. Fields

## Performance

- Do not create or destroy GPU resources (meshes, textures, buffers) inside
  input callbacks such as mouse, keyboard, or hand motion handlers. These
  callbacks can fire many times per frame, and Vulkan buffer creation involves
  staging buffers, memory allocation, and device transfers that can cause
  frame-time spikes and resource churn.
- Prefer creating resources once at initialization and updating their data or
  transform per frame instead. For meshes whose vertex positions change but
  whose topology is static, reuse the existing buffers and re-upload vertex
  data (see `mais::GPUMesh::updateVertices`).

## Checklist Before Opening A PR

- Naming follows conventions.
- Class and method order is consistent.
- No obvious duplication.
- Error handling is present where needed.
- Formatting is clean and consistent.
