# Third-party dependencies

This directory contains vendored copies of all third-party dependencies used by
Mais. They are consumed at configure time via `FetchContent` with a local
`SOURCE_DIR`, so no network access is required to build the project.

Each dependency is pinned to a specific upstream version. To update a
dependency, replace the contents of its directory with the new upstream release
and update the version recorded below.

## Notes

- The vendored copies are stripped of their `.git` directories and
  `.gitmodules` files to keep the repository lean.
- Each dependency retains its own license file; refer to the individual
  `LICENSE`/`COPYING` files for the exact terms.
- The `etib-corp` sibling library (`utility`) is intentionally not vendored; it
  is fetched via `FetchContent` with a local-checkout override for development.
